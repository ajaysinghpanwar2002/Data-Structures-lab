6. Threaded Binary Tree -- CO1, CO2, CO3, CO5

Implement In-order Threaded Binary Tree and traverse it in In-order and Pre-order

steps to convert
1) keep the leftmost and rightmost Null pointers as null 
2) change all others NULL pointers as 

left nullpointer = Inorder Predecessor
right nullpointer = Inorder successor

3) we'll add flags 
flag == 1 means child is present 
flag == 0 means pointing to ancestor, no child is present
